 Fun with the Twitter API!

### user_topics.py
This quick little program returns a maximum of 10 cleaned-stemmed-and-tokenized topics with the top retweeted tweet that includes that topic, as a sampling of what a Twitter user has been talking about recently. It can be installed and run from your terminal. You'll need to create your own `twitter_secrets.py` to return your own API tokens. 
When running as `__main__`, you'll also need to provide a valid Twitter handle (example: `py user_topics.py POTUS`).
